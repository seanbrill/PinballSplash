# Pinball Splash - Unity Game Jam Project

## Overview

Pinball Splash is a 2.5-D pinball game created for a mini project at Penn State. Developed in just three hours, the game features a swimming pool theme, with players controlling flippers to keep the ball in play. Various obstacles, such as springs and bumpers, add excitement and contribute to the player's score. The project involves a dedicated team of developers specializing in graphics, physics, user interface, and game design.

## Project Details

### Game Concept

Pinball Splash is a classic pinball game set in a summer-themed environment. The goal is to achieve the highest score by skillfully using flippers to navigate the ball through the playfield, interacting with different objects for bonus points.

### Controls

- **Initial Launch:** S or Spacebar or ↓
- **Left Flipper:** A or ←
- **Right Flipper:** D or →

### Art Style

The game adopts a summer-themed art style with computer-generated shaders and textures. To maintain simplicity, 3D assets are avoided, and basic 3D shapes are utilized for obstacles.

### Required Assets

#### Shaders

- Flat Pool Water Shader
- Beach Ball Shader
- Plastic Pool Float Shader
- Pool Mat Shader
- Wall & Flipper (Wood) Texture Shader - World Scale
- Post-Processing Blur Shader

#### Sound Effects (Credit-Free)

- Ball hitting flipper
- Ball bouncing off bumper
- Spring/initial launch
- Points score (e.g., splash)
- Background music
- Loss state sound

### Menus

- Main Menu
- Settings
- LeaderBoard

### UI

- Scoreboard
- Power meter for the ball launcher
- Multiball meter
- Lives
- Score popups when gaining points

### Obstacles & Board Pieces

- Ball: Spherical, beach ball shader
- Pool Tubes: Standard bumper, torus-shaped
- Pool Mat Floats: Spring, rectangular
